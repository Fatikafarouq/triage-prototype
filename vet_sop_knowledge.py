  VetDesk AI — SOP Knowledge Base  (Phase 3, Part A)
  vet_sop_knowledge.py
=============================================================
  This file IS your SOP in Python form.
  It holds every piece of clinic knowledge as a list of
  plain-text chunks — the same content as your Word document
  but in a format the RAG engine can search.

  HOW TO CUSTOMISE:
    - Replace [CLINIC NAME], [PHONE], [ADDRESS] etc. with real values
    - Add or remove chunks to match your actual clinic
    - Each chunk should cover ONE topic (one price, one rule, etc.)
    - Shorter chunks = more precise answers
    - This file works for BOTH the US and Nigerian clinic editions —
      just update the content to match your version

  ADDING NEW CHUNKS:
    Just append to the CHUNKS list:
      "Your new fact here. As a complete sentence."
